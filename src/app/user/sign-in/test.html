<p>CRM, or Customer relationship management, is a strategy and at times refers to technology or an application that is used to build stronger relationships between companies and their customers. A CRM software integrates the entire customer relationship cycle by automating sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>While this may be true for CRM in other industries like Fast Moving Consumer Goods there are subtle differences in the requirements of a Bank CRM. These differences arise from the following</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li><font size="3">Banks and Financial institutions do not mass sell their products using the traditional sales and distribution channels that are used by companies selling consumer goods. They employ their own network or channels to market their services at the most they sign-up Direct Selling Agents to do the selling.</font></li>
<li><font size="3">Unlike in other industries, A prospective customer cannot walk-in to a Bank’s branch and purchase a product on demand. A Bank evaluates the prospective customer based on eligibility criteria before it even considers to provide a service.</font></li>
<li><font size="3">A Bank has both individuals and corporates has customers and within these two broad classifications there are several sub-classifications and the demographic and financial data captured for these are different.</font></li>

<p>So the lifecycle of a lead before it gets converted to a customer is different in a Bank and not similar to the lifecycle of a lead in other industries. Most CRM’s developed for other industry verticals are woefully inadequate when it comes to handling leads in a Bank.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WhileCRM mainly deals with enhancing and maintaining the customer relationship in other industries, in a Bank it helps in automating several stages of the workflow.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>It allows sales personnel to source applications from the field, capture key data elements during customer meetings; Track the status of the leads as activities are performed downstream; capture notes of meetings and calls and schedule future meetings with a prospective customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>For Banks and Financial institutions with Centralised Processing Cells a Bank CRM should be able to automate several routine tasks like Eligibility checks, Credit Policy Checks, Risk Checks, Credit Bureau Checks etc.</p>

<br />
&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to these It should also enable the Bank to understand the prospective customer’s sentiments and buying options so that the Bank can provide them with a suitable set of financial products based on their risk and credit profile. All this is very easily and efficiently done by a Bank CRM whereas a CRM built for other industries lacks the capability to assess a lead.</p>

<p><font size="5">Identify your customers</font></p>

<blockquote>
<p>To create a one to one initiative, the Bank must be able to identify the constituent of the lead at the very beginning of the sales cycle. This helps in selling the right products. It also determines the entity, whether the individual in his or her own capacity or the organisation they represent that is the beneficiary of the banking service.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>If you operate in countries like India this becomes important as organisations like CERSAI <a href="www.cersai.org.in">https:www.cersai.org.in</a> have been established for Banks to file registrations of transactions that involve assets, securitisation and other security interest. This helps Banks in identifying assets that have already been funded. (The AB Suite was designed to ensure that entities are identified on the same lines as the CERSAI guidelines)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While in other industries customer differentiation is focussed on the offerings, in a bank a CRM has to have the additional capability to determine the risk based on the customer constituents.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Banks have individuals and organisations as customers. Within these two broad classifications there are about ten constituents and each of these constituents have a different method of calculating their Income and Expenses. Incorrectly calculating their net worth can pose significant risk to the Bank especially on the asset side of the business.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interaction is also a crucial component of a successful CRM initiative. It should be kept in mind that interaction just not happen only through marketing and sales channels, customers interact in many different channels with many different areas of the Bank. It should be possible for key Bank staff to reach the Customer and have a timeline record of the conversations that have taken place. This helps the Bank in evaluating the commitments that the staff have made to the customer on interest rates, fees etc.</p>

<p>It costs a lot more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one. To accomplish this the sales and marketing teams should be informed when a particular product relationship is nearing its end. The sales and marketing teams can then initiate marketing activities to cross-sell other products. Infact the AB Suite allows sales teams to cross-sell products in the beginning of the relationship.</p>

<p>The prime aspect of a Bank CRM is that it should be cost-effective and shouldn’t call for a great deal of customisations as most of the workflows are standard and mostly regulated by the central bank of the country. Whether you opt for per processor pricing or per user pricing or per branch pricing the revenue stream should justify the total cost of ownership for the Bank CRM.</p>
